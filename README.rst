**Alpha Release**. `OpenFermion <http://openfermion.org>`_ is an open source library for
obtaining and manipulating representations of fermionic systems (including
quantum chemistry) for simulation on quantum computers.
`Cirq <https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq>`_ is an open source library for
writing, manipulating, and optimizing quantum circuits and running them
against quantum computers and simulators. OpenFermion-Cirq extends the functionality of
OpenFermion by providing routines and tools for using Cirq to compile and compose circuits
for quantum simulation algorithms.

Getting started
===============

Installing OpenFermion-Cirq requires pip. Make sure that you are using an up-to-date version of it.
Once installation is complete, be sure to take a look at our
`ipython tutorials
<https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion-Cirq/blob/master/examples>`__
and
`code documentation
<https://openfermion-cirq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.

Installation
------------

To install the latest PyPI releases as libraries (in user mode):

.. code-block:: bash

  python -m pip install --user openfermioncirq


Developer install
-----------------

To install the latest versions of OpenFermion, Cirq and OpenFermion-Cirq (in development mode):

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion-Cirq
  cd OpenFermion-Cirq
  python -m pip install -e .

Alpha Disclaimer
================

**OpenFermion-Cirq is currently in alpha.**
We are still making breaking changes.
We *will* break your code when we make new releases.
We recommend that you target a specific version of OpenFermion-Cirq, and periodically bump to the latest release.
That way you have control over when a breaking change affects you.
